# Multiplicity

The multiplicity of a macrostate, is the number of microstates corresponding to that macrostate (Schroeder, 1999). The Einstein solid is a model of a crystalline solid that contains many independent three-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillators of similar frequency (Mandl, 1988). In the solid, each atom can oscillate in 3 independent directions. Where we have q units of energy and N oscillators, all of the energy levels are considered to be equally probable. These solids can share energy back and forth (Schroeder, 1999).

The aim of the experiment is to compare the plots of multiplicities that arise from varying the amount of oscillators (N) and the energy levels (q) of these solids when interacting with one another. We also aim to predict the most probable macrostates from the plots of the different multiplicities. We then aim to deduce that heat flow is an irreversible process, and from this state the Second Law of Thermodynamics.
